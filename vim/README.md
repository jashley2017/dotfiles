# Josh's Vim Configuration 

Some Vim Magic. I personally use Neovim but this configuration also works for vim. 

## The highlights:

* NERDTREE - for directory navigation in vim
* Mardown Preview - for autoview of markdown in github flavor
* ale - lovely async syntax checker
* airline - added information at the margins about buffers and file attributes
* supertab - tab autocomplete is the only way to live
* polyglot - better syntax highlighting becuase I like colors
* gruvbox

## Install
The install is covered one directory up. Its just a simple shell script to replace your RC's with mine.
